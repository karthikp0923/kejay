<h2>Design</h2>
- Making the first page was very simple. I set a background image using my css file.
- To make the header, I started with the respective header tag, styled it in css and added my logo in the center of it. 
- I researched some basic icons in HTML, such as the arrow down at the bottom of the page, and added it. 
- I included a little style tag for placing the logo in the middle.
- The next section was my brand statement. Since i wanted my webstie to have a unique design, I made it so that the page actually pops out of the regular frame and slides upward as you scroll. 
- Below the brand statement is a picture of me, and if you click on it, it will redirect you to my instagram page. I did this by using the "a" tag
- The next section showcases my music. Spotify gives you the code to embed a preview of your song in a HTML website. 
- I set the background to one of my cover arts for my song, it also gave it a nice look. Below the previews is a button that redirects you to my spotify page. 
- The last section showcases my merchandise. It previews some clothing, but if you click on buy now, it redirects you to another website where you can buy the product. (I made the website myself as well)
