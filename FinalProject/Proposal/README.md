### My project is about creating an artist webpage.

+ This webpage will have all details of the artist. Everything from background, history, released music, upcoming shows, signing up for email list, etc. I will be using a HTML, css and java to execute this webpage.

- I am planning to combine my project with my professional development seminar class. That class requires us to make a artist webpage and it can be made anyway we like, so I decided to make it in HTML. 

A good outcome for my final project would have the all the features listed above on the page.

A better outcome would be to make the webpage look aesthetic to the viewer.

The best outcome would be, to have everything listed above with a beautiful aesthetic, professional design (comparing to other artist pages)

Some skills I need to acquire is, look at other artist pages and learn how to replicate some of the designs and features. I would have to research how to desgins similar to an example like: [https://martingarrix.com](https://martingarrix.com)
